Neural Geometry Fields (NGFs) are a recent hybrid approach for 3D shape representation that combines the structural clarity of meshes with the flexibility of neural networks. \\
This paper offers a detailed and accessible overview of the NGF pipeline, covering surface partitioning, neural deformation, and inverse rendering. \\
Each stage is explained with a focus on conceptual understanding and practical implementation, making the method approachable for readers without deep expertise in computer graphics. \\
Beyond this technical walkthrough, we critically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of NGFs in terms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, differentiability, and runtime performance. \\
While NGFs demonstrate strong potential for real-time, high-quality 3D geometry processing, they also face challenges such as preprocessing complexity and limited topological flexibility. \\
This overview aims to contextualize NGFs within the broader landscape of 3D representation methods and provide a foundation for future exploration and application.
